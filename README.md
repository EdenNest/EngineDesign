### Project Overview
The project is conducted as part of an academic course at Sharif University of Technology and entails the detailed design and analysis of axial compressors under ideal and simulated real-life conditions. It emphasizes both theoretical understanding and practical application, requiring the integration of MATLAB for simulation and design calculations.

### Objectives
- **Design Philosophy**: The compressor design is explained with justifications for chosen methodologies, such as constant tip speed, constant mean diameter, or pitch variations. These choices affect the overall performance and efficiency of the compressor at various operating conditions.
- **Performance Analysis**: Simulating compressor behavior at different phases like takeoff and sea level static conditions. It includes adjustments for profile and secondary losses to approximate real-world performances.
- **3D Modeling**: Utilizing tools like SolidWorks and ANSYS BladeGen to render a realistic model of the compressor, facilitating better visualization and further finite element analysis.

### Methodology
- **Mathematical Modeling**: Employing a variety of MATLAB scripts to calculate important compressor parameters such as pressure ratios, temperature changes across the compressor stages, and aerodynamic coefficients.
- **Velocity Triangles**: Detailed construction of velocity triangles at different sections of the compressor (tip, mean, and hub) to analyze the velocity components and their impact on compressor efficiency and performance.
- **Stage-by-Stage Design**: A thorough design process for each compressor stage, examining parameters like angle of attacks, de Haller number, and diffusion factors to ensure aerodynamic stability and performance optimization.

### Results
- **Performance Metrics**: Reporting on key performance indicators such as efficiency, pressure rise, temperature distribution, and stage-by-stage analysis under different operating conditions.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Evaluating the compressor performance at cruise phase and other flight regimes, comparing these results with the design point to identify deviations and potential improvements.

### Conclusions and Discussion
- **Evaluation of Design Choices**: Discussing the efficacy of the selected design approaches and their alignment with the theoretical expectations.
- **Material and Component Analysis**: Estimating the weight of components using appropriate materials and calculating the tensions and margin of safety on the compressor components.
- **Optimization Suggestions**: Proposing modifications based on the observed performance deficits during the simulated conditions, aiming to enhance efficiency and reduce losses.
